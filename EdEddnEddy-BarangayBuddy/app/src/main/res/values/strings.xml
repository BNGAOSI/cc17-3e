    <string name="history_ambiong_desc">Long time ago, Barangay Ambiong was a part of a vast land in La Trinidad. However, it got no name during those times until settlers from Kabayan, Bokod, Amburayan, Ampusongan and Kibungan of Benguet came. Majority of the natives who settled in the area were the Ibalois and Kankanaeys. The term Ambiong originally came from the ibaloi word “AMBIONGAN” which generally means “BLACK CARPET BEES”. These bees were often found in the rolling hills and forests where wild flowers and the thick foliage used to abound. They also make their shelters by drilling through the trunk of dead trees. Ambiong was predominantly a thick lush, rich flora and fauna up until the 1960’s. For a long time, before the modern era, the area was purposely for hunting and food gathering activities. \n \n \n Generally, the Barangay was a part of Barangay Eastern Pico but it was separated in 1948 by virtue of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 3590 and P.D. No. 557. Since then, it was called BARANGAY AMBIONG.
